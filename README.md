# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
### Hello,
This Repository was created to house my completed notebooks and powerpoint for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project
for predicting Space X Falcon 9 first stage landing success. 
The date as of writing this readme is 2/19/2022.
I hope you enjoy the project!


The Denis O'Byrne IBM Data Science Capstone Project.pdf file is the presentation for the assignment

The notebook files were completed as part of the assignment and all data is hosted online except for the data for the dashboard project so that is provided in the repository
Some files like the Plotly Dashboard and the Folium Visualizations need to be run externaly as they are not interactive on github.
They should run without issue through jupyter environments on your local computer.
